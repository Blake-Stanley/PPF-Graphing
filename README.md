# PPF-Graphing
A Python program that takes input to create a price productions frontier graph, states and explains the comparative and absolute advantage, and graphs all the possible mutually beneficial trades (with whole numbers only). 


This program was created for my economics teacher to enable him to easily create PPF graphs that showed all the possible mutually beneficial trades using whole numbers.
